Libft is the very first project as a student at 42.
<br>
The goal is to recode a few functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that we will use during our whole cursus.

The libft folder is the one that will be evaluated by the moulinette. By openning this folder you can launch the tester francinette to easily check this project.

My result :slot_machine:

I create a test_libft folder to check all of my libft function individually.
<br>
Do the following command on the root of the project to compile functions:
<br><br> 
compile all libft functions with the following command:

```bash
make
```

Compile only one libft function with the following command (replace nameOfTheFunction by the name of the function you want to compile):

```bash
make ft_nameOfTheFunction
```

after compiling you can launch the program with the following command(replace nameOfTheFunction by the name of the function you want to compile):

```bash
./ft_nameOfTheFunction
```
<br>
Give the argument needed to test it correctly (check which argument is needed in the code)
